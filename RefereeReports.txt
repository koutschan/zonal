This paper establishes several new results about the coefficients of zonal
polynomials, which arise in a number of areas. The Introduction is engaging
and does an excellent job of motivating the study of zonal polynomials and
their computation. Example 2.6 is well-timed, since it makes the discussion of
zonal polynomials and their appearance in the Wishart distribution
concrete. The results appear to be correct (and indeed are implemented in
accompanying SageMath and Mathematica packages).

I only have a few minor corrections:

1.
Introduction, last paragraph:
The description "In Section 4 we investigate the question under which
conditions a coefficient becomes zero" might be too modest, since in addition
to investigating this question you're able to answer it.

2.
Page 3, first bulleted item:
There is a duplicate "for".

3.
Page 15, line -4:
Presumably "polynomials" should be singular in "all zonal polynomials coefficients".

4.
In the demo file ZonalPolynomialsDemo.nb, examples in the later sections do
not work as expected due to the symbols ZonalC and Vars, which seem to not be
defined by the package.

I have suggested the acceptance of this paper because the quality of the work,
as well as its usefulness.

The paper is well organized, clear, and concise. The main analytical results
are clearly stated and the software is well exemplified.

The calculation of zonal polynomials will certainly be more tractable with the
help of results and software introduced in this paper.
