1. I have downloaded the “Springer's Macro Latex Template” at 
https://www.springer.com/gp/livingreviews/latex-templates, 
as required in “Text Formatting”.

2. Both telephone numbers and the ORCID numbers are added. I copied from your personal website, please double check it.

3. \usepackage{amsmath} added for the \genfrac, used in pFq.

4. \usepackage{amsthm} is commented. It seems that there is a conflict between it and the templete's default setting. 

5. \qedhere is not available in Springer, therefore deleted. 
It seems that the default setting of Springer does not show the qed box. 

6. There is a strange requirement: 
Acknowledgments
Acknowledgments of people, grants, funds, etc. should be placed in a separate section on the title
page. The names of funding organizations should be written in full.

Therefore, I followed by putting acknowledgement at the very beginning. 

7. Due to the narrow width, I have to adjust several formulas (e.g., the one in the proof of Lemma 1, P. 9). 
Please also adjust one output on Page 20.
