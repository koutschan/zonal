1. I have downloaded the “Springer's Macro Latex Template” at 
https://www.springer.com/gp/livingreviews/latex-templates, 
as required in “Text Formatting”.

2. Both telephone numbers and the ORCID numbers are added. I copied from your personal website, please double check it.

3. \usepackage{amsmath} added for the \genfrac, used in pFq.

4. \usepackage{amsthm} is commented. It seems that there is a conflict between it and the templete's default setting. 

5. \qedhere is not available in Springer, therefore deleted. 
It seems that the default setting of Springer does not show the qed box.
